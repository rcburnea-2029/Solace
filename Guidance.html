				<h3>Emotional Awareness</h3>
				<p>
					Emotional awareness is the ability to recognize and name what you are feeling in the moment. It helps you notice your emotional patterns, understand what triggers them, and communicate your feelings more clearly. By becoming more aware of your emotions, you gain the first step toward managing them with confidence.

				<h3>Emotional Understanding</h3>
				<p>
					Emotional understanding means knowing why you feel a certain way and what experiences or needs are connected to those feelings. When you understand the reasons behind your emotions, you are able to respond instead of react, and you develop greater empathy for yourself and others. This understanding creates space for healthier choices and responses.

				<h3>Emotional Regulation</h3>
				<p>
					Emotional regulation is the skill of managing your emotions in healthy and supportive ways. It involves calming techniques like deep breathing, journaling to process thoughts, stepping away to reset, or talking to someone you trust. When you regulate your emotions, you stay balanced, grounded, and in control even during stressful moments.
